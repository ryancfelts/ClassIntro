# ClassIntro
My name is Ryan Felts and I am a recent college graduate from UNCC. I majored in Mathematics for Business with a concentration in Operations Research.
I would like to be able to work remotely and travel the world.
Many jobs that I apply for require some type of coding and the more skills I can add to my resume the better.
